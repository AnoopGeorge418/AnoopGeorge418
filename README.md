## âœ… **Completed Projects**
### **1. [Crop Yield Prediction Project](https://github.com/AnoopGeorge418/Crop-Yield-Prediction)**

    - Developed a predictive model for estimating crop yield based on environmental and agricultural factors using machine learning algorithms.
    - Implemented data preprocessing and feature engineering techniques, including handling missing values, scaling, and feature selection, to improve model performance.
    - Built regression models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.) to accurately forecast crop yield, optimizing for RMSE and RÂ² metrics.
    - Utilized Python and key libraries (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn) to analyze, visualize, and interpret agricultural data trends.
    - Build the app for this model using Flask for an interactive web application, enabling stakeholders to make data-driven decisions for agricultural planning.

### **2. [Fake News Prediction Project]()**

    - Developed a machine learning model to classify news articles as real or fake using natural language processing (NLP) techniques.
    - Preprocessed text data by removing stop words, tokenizing, and vectorizing using TF-IDF.
    - Implemented and compared classification models, including Logistic Regression, and identified the best model based on accuracy and F1 score.
    - Evaluated model performance using cross-validation, precision, recall, and F1 score metrics.
    - Utilized Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and NLTK for data processing and model building.

### **3. [Movie Recommendation System Project]()**
    - Developed a recommendation system to suggest movies to users based on their preferences and viewing history.
    - Implemented collaborative filtering techniques, including user-based and item-based filtering, to predict user ratings for movies.
    - Utilized matrix factorization methods such as Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to improve recommendation accuracy.
    - Evaluated model performance using metrics like RMSE and precision at K.
    - Utilized Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and Surprise library for data processing and model building.
